# MATLAB Code for Optimal Sum-Throughput Analysis for Downlink Cooperative SWIPT NOMA Systems 

## Key Points:
- Derive the approximated closed-form expression for the sum-throughput of a downlink cooperative SWIPT NOMA system (via outage probability). 
- Formulate an unconstraint maximization problem to find the optimal power-splitting ratio that returns the maximum instantaneous system throughput.
- MATLAB code for the used Gradient descent method. 
- MATLAB code for a toy example of Newton method.
